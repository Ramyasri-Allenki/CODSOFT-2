- Enter positions using index numbers:

# CODSOFT-2
tictactoe  This project is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human plays against an unbeatable AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, ensuring it always makes the optimal move. The game demonstrates AI decision-making, recursion, and search algorithms in Python. Players can choose X or O and play using positions 0–8. 
0 | 1 | 2
---+---+---
3 | 4 | 5
---+---+---
6 | 7 | 8

- The AI will automatically play the best move

## 🧠 AI Algorithm Overview

### Minimax Algorithm  
Evaluates all possible game states and selects the optimal move.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning  
Speeds up Minimax by removing unnecessary branches.

### Scoring  
- AI win: +10 - depth  
- Human win: -10 + depth  
- Draw: 0

# Project Documentation
## Tic-Tac-Toe AI Using Minimax With Alpha-Beta Pruning

---

## 1. Introduction
This project implements a human vs AI Tic-Tac-Toe game.  
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, ensuring it never loses.  
The purpose of the project is to understand game trees, search algorithms, and AI-based decision making.

---

## 2. Objective
- To build an unbeatable AI for Tic-Tac-Toe  
- To implement Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning  
- To demonstrate adversarial search  
- To create a simple, interactive console-based game

---

## 3. Tools and Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3.8+  
- **Concepts:** Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Game Trees  
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming  
- **Platform:** Console/Terminal  

---

## 4. System Overview

### 4.1 Game Board  
The board handles:
- Player moves  
- Tracking empty positions  
- Checking winners  
- Displaying the grid  

### 4.2 AI Agent  
Responsibilities:
- Evaluating possible outcomes  
- Simulating future moves  
- Choosing the best optimal move  
- Using Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning  

---

## 5. Minimax Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm simulates all possible game states:  
- The AI maximizes score  
- The human minimizes score  

This ensures the AI always chooses the strongest move.

---

## 6. Alpha-Beta Pruning
This optimization reduces unnecessary Minimax calculations, making the AI faster without changing results.

---

## 7. Scoring System
- **AI wins:** `+10 - depth`  
- **Human wins:** `-10 + depth`  
- **Draw:** `0`  

Depth ensures:
- Faster wins are preferred  
- Slower losses are preferred  

---

## 8. Gameplay Flow
1. Human chooses X or O  
2. X always starts first  
3. Human enters a move using positions 0–8  
4. AI responds with the best move  
5. Game ends on:
   - Win  
   - Loss  
   - Draw  

---

## 9. Sample Output

Jai Shree Ram 🙏  
Tic-Tac-Toe — Human vs Unbeatable AI  

Choose your symbol (X/O). X goes first: X  
Enter your move (0-8):  

---

## 10. Advantages
- AI is impossible to defeat  
- Simple and clean Python code  
- Single-file project  
- Great for understanding AI algorithms
